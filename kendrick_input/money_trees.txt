Uh, me and my niggas tryna get it, ya bish  Ya bish 
Hit the house lick: tell me, is you wit' it, ya bish?  Ya bish 
Home invasion was persuasive  Was persuasive 
From nine to five I know it's vacant, ya bish  Ya bish 
Dreams of livin' life like rappers do  Like rappers do 
Back when condom wrappers wasn't cool  They wasn't cool 
I fucked Sherane and went to tell my bros  Tell my bros 
Then Usher Raymond "Let It Burn" came on  "Let Burn" came on 
Hot sauce all in our Top Ramen, ya bish  Ya bish 
Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish  Ya bish 
The only thing we had to free our mind  Free our mind 
Then freeze that verse when we see dollar signs  See dollar signs 
You lookin' like a easy come-up, ya bish  Ya bish 
A silver spoon I know you come from, ya bish  Ya bish 
And that's a lifestyle that we never knew  We never knew 
Go at a reverend for the revenue


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
 The one in front of the gun, forever 
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel

Dreams of livin' life like rappers do  Like rappers do 
Bump that new E-40 after school  Way after school 
You know, "Big Ballin' With My Homies"  My homies 
Earl Stevens had us thinkin' rational  Thinkin' rational, that's rational 
Back to reality, we poor, ya bish  Ya bish 
Another casualty at war, ya bish  Ya bish 
Two bullets in my uncle Tony head  My Tony head 
He said one day I'll be on tour, ya bish  Ya bish 
That Louis Burgers never be the same  Won't be the same 
A Louis belt that never ease that pain  Won't ease that pain 
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin'  That day is jerkin' 
Pull off at Church's, with Pirellis skirtin'  Pirellis skirtin' 
Gang signs out the window, ya bish  Ya bish 
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish  Ya bish 
They say your hood is a pot of gold  A pot of gold 
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
 The one in front of the gun, forever 
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel

Nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel


Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way!
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way!
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!


Imagine Rock up in them projects
Where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings
Liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin'
Ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga
I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue
Every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do
When you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em
Get the fuck up out my way, bitch
Got that drum and I got them bands
Just like a parade, bitch
Drop that work up in the bushes
Hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth
This the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut
Them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs
But it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch
And tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a FootLocker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree


It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
 The one in front of the gun, forever 
And I been hustlin' all day
This-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel
